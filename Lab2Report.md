***Part 3: Something New I learned***
---
From Lab 2 in week 2, I learned how to edit a block of code that is meant to start up a local server. With some edits to this block of code, I was able to change the information that was displayed on this web server such as the text displayed before the number count was updated. I learned how to start up and turn on a web server and how to update it by remotely closing it, turning it back on for the updates to kick in. With URLs and URIs, I was able to change aspects of a web server with keywords to add specific things to it. Lab 2 also taught me that we can edit other peoples' web servers as long as we had the specific port number they used and knew what their web server was supposed to do. In lab 3, I learned a great deal about Junit tests and how to properly set them up. I learned the advantages of using and creating our own Junit tests, and specifically how they can be used to fix aspects of our code for a more effective and efficient result.
