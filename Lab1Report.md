# ***Step 1: Installing VScode*** 1
---
I didn't have to install VScode, as I already had it installed from when I took CSE 11. 
However in order to install VScode, you must first have java version 17 or above installed. 
Next, head over https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the installation instrcutions. 
After installing Vscode, you should be able to launch the program and a window similar to this one should open up.
